         I'm a <b>dedicated and curious learner</b> with a strong passion for exploring the many 
         dimensions of computer science. My interests particularly lie in <b>artificial intelligence and 
         machine learning, </b>
         where Iâ€™m constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of how intelligent systems are built 
         and optimized. Whether it's diving into the math behind algorithms or experimenting 
         with real-world applications ,I find great excitement in the process of learning and building.
